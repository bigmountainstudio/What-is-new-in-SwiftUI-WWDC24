# SwiftUI Views Mastery
## CONTROL VIEWS
* [ScrollView(limitBehavior: .alwaysByFew)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewalignedscrolltargetbehavior) Limits the number of views scrolled to (one or few). Note: It's a new parameter.
* [ScrollView.onScrollGeometryChange(for:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onscrollgeometrychange(for:of:action:)/) React to scrolling changes.
* [ScrollView.onScrollPhaseChange](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/onScrollPhaseChange(_:)-7mica) React to changes in the scroll phase (animating, decelerating, idle, interacting, tracking)
* [ScrollView.onScrollVisibilityChange(threshold:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/onScrollVisibilityChange(threshold:_:)) Trigger action when scrolled past a point.
* [ScrollView.scrollPosition(:anchor:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/scrollPosition(_:anchor:)) Scroll to a view, offset, or edge.
* [Tab](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/tab) The `tabItem` modifier is deprecated. Use this new `Tab` view to construct tabs.
* [Text(format:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/formatstyle) New format styles functions (offset, reference, stopwatch, timer counting down & up)
## IMAGE (Might consider extracting Symbols into its own section)
